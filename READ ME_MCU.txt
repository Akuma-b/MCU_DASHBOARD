MCU Box Office Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building a Power BI dashboard for analyzing Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) box office performance. The dashboard is designed to be clean, professional, and visually engaging, using a custom Marvel-themed color palette.

1. Project Goal
The primary objective is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore key financial and critical metrics for MCU films. The dashboard is built to provide insights into box office performance, production budgets, and audience reception.

2. Required Data
The dashboard is built using the mcu_box_office.csv dataset. This file contains the following key columns:

movie_title: The name of the film.

mcu_phase: The MCU phase the film belongs to.

3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following measures were created to provide high-level insights into the data:

Total Worldwide Box Office

Total Production Budget

Average ROI (Return on Investment)

4. Custom Marvel Color Theme
A custom theme was created to give the dashboard a distinctive Marvel look and feel. To apply this theme, save the following JSON code as MarvelTheme.json and import it into Power BI via the View tab.

The dashboard is organized into the following sections:
